# TCM

TCM is a small, local reasoning engine built on an open-source base model.

## v0.1 Goal

- Use a small local model.
- Implement a single mode: **ARCHITECT** (planning / structure).
- Route prompts through a tiny orchestrator script.
- Condition the model with a small TCM dataset (JSONL).

No memory.  
No tools.  
No extra modes.  
Just: one mode, one model, one script.
