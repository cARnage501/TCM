# TCM Tasks (v0.1)

- [ ] Verify `architect_cli` works with Ollama and the `llama3.2:3b` model.
- [ ] Tune ARCHITECT prompt until the plans feel structurally solid.
- [ ] Add 10–20 more TCM dataset samples focused specifically on planning and decomposition.
- [ ] Decide whether v0.1 needs any memory at all (default: no).
- [ ] Once v0.1 is stable, define scope for v0.2 (orchestrator + basic context management).
