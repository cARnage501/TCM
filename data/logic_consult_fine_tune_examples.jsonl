{"input": "Given A and B tend to co-occur and G sometimes follows on a rolling basis, with this limited scope of information what can you deduce about this?", "output": "### Propositions\n- P1: A and B tend to co-occur.\n- P2: G sometimes follows on a rolling basis.\n\n### Variables / Unknowns\n- What 'rolling basis' means operationally.\n- Magnitude or probability of 'sometimes'.\n\n### Candidate Models\n- M1: A and B are correlated but not predictive of G.\n- M2: G's occurrence is influenced by A and B's co-occurrence.\n\n### Evaluation\n- M1: weak support due to lack of connection to G.\n- M2: moderate support because the input explicitly links G with A+B.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Best-supported model: M2.\n- Underdetermined: definition of 'rolling basis'; without it the strength of inference is limited.\n"}
